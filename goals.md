That's great to hear! It sounds like you're making excellent progress with your text editor. Here are some ideas for enhancing your shortcut system and overall functionality:

Ideas for Custom Shortcuts and Features

1. Customizable Shortcut Definitions:

Allow users to define their own shortcuts through a settings menu or configuration file, enabling them to tailor the editor to their needs.



2. Dynamic Shortcut Management:

Implement functionality to add, edit, and remove shortcuts directly within the editor interface, making it user-friendly.



3. Auto-Completion:

Provide an auto-completion feature that suggests shortcuts as the user types, helping them remember and utilize shortcuts more easily.



4. Shortcut Reference Guide:

Create a help or reference section within the editor that lists all available shortcuts and their corresponding actions.



5. Multi-Line Shortcuts:

Enable shortcuts that can insert multi-line templates, such as a common code structure or a block of text.



6. Context-Sensitive Shortcuts:

Implement context-aware shortcuts that change depending on the current editing context (e.g., different shortcuts for Markdown vs. HTML).



7. Plugin System for Extended Shortcuts:

Develop a plugin system where users can install additional shortcut packs or features created by the community.



8. Markdown/HTML Support:

Support more complex Markdown or HTML shortcuts, like tables, lists, or custom elements.



9. Keyboard Shortcuts:

Introduce keyboard shortcuts for common actions (e.g., save, format text) that work alongside your text shortcuts.



10. Undo/Redo Functionality:

Implement an undo/redo feature to allow users to revert or reapply changes made with shortcuts.



11. Theming and Custom Styles:

Allow users to customize the appearance of the editor, including themes and font styles, to enhance usability and aesthetics.



12. Collaboration Features:

If you’re feeling ambitious, consider adding real-time collaboration features, so multiple users can edit the same document simultaneously.



13. Export Options:

Provide options to export documents in various formats (e.g., PDF, Markdown, HTML) to make sharing easier.



14. Version Control:

Integrate a version control system to track changes and allow users to revert to previous versions of their documents.



15. Feedback and Suggestions:

Create a feedback mechanism where users can suggest new features or report bugs, helping you improve the editor over time.




Implementation Tips:

User Feedback: Regularly seek feedback from users to prioritize which features to develop next.

Documentation: Keep your documentation updated with the new features and shortcuts to help users make the most of your text editor.
