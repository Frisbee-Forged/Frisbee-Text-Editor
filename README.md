# frisbee : The Sigma Text Editor

i made this text editor in like, 48 hours or something, as like a way to improve my javascript, html and css
this is like my first actual project that i put some effort in, it has the usual formatting, has some shortcuts
and you can make your own using a stupidly unsecure system (dont use eval chat!), and has some themes, it has light,
dark and a reddish dark mode (it looks ass).


please dont use it. i am might update it or something but idk
also dont use my code its fucking shit.
